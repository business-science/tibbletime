Description: Built on top of the 'tibble' package, 'tibbletime' is an extension
  that allows for the creation of time aware tibbles. Some immediate
  advantages of this include: the ability to perform time based subsetting
  on tibbles, quickly summarising and aggregating results by time periods,
  and calling functions similar in spirit to the map family from 'purrr'
  on time based tibbles.
