Description: Built on top of the 'tibble' package, 'tibbletime' is an extension
  that allows for the creation of time aware tibbles. Some immediate
  advantages of this include: the ability to perform time-based subsetting
  on tibbles, quickly summarising and aggregating results by time periods,
  and creating columns that can be used as 'dplyr' time-based groups.
